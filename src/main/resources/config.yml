# Splash Plugin Configuration

# Splash effect settings
splash:
  # Radius of the splash effect (in blocks)
  # Higher values create larger splashes
  radius: 3
  
  # Whether the splash blocks are permanent or disappear
  # true = blocks stay forever
  # false = blocks disappear after duration
  permanent: false
  
  # Duration in seconds before blocks disappear (only used if permanent is false)
  duration: 5
  
  # Material to use for the splash effect
  # Common options: WATER, LAVA, GLASS, CONCRETE, etc.
  # See: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
  material: WATER
  
  # Optional: Restrict splash effect to a specific area
  # If enabled, splash will only occur when landing within the defined coordinates
  # Set to null or leave empty to allow splash everywhere
  area:
    # First corner coordinates (X, Y, Z)
    # Set to null to disable area restriction
    corner1:
      x: null
      y: null
      z: null
    # Second corner coordinates (X, Y, Z)
    # Set to null to disable area restriction
    corner2:
      x: null
      y: null
      z: null
    # Example: To restrict splash to area from (10, 64, 20) to (30, 80, 40):
    # corner1: {x: 10, y: 64, z: 20}
    # corner2: {x: 30, y: 80, z: 40}
